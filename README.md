**A lightweight web platform for engineering managers to run their day-to-day work effectively.**

Cadence is your control centre for management work—bringing together tasks, meetings, delivery data, and personal growth in one clear, organised place.


## What is Cadence?

Cadence helps engineering managers:

- 📋 **Stay organised** - Track tasks, follow-ups, and commitments in one place
- 👥 **Manage teams** - Keep context on people, 1:1s, and team dynamics
- 📊 **Understand delivery** - Track capacity and delivery patterns over time
- 🎯 **Invest in growth** - Set and track your own career progression goals

### What Cadence is NOT

- ❌ Not a Jira replacement
- ❌ Not an HR system
- ❌ Not a performance management tool
- ❌ Not an AI-driven decision platform

Cadence supports good management habits—it doesn't automate judgement.
